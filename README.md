Bubble Sort
Objective: Implement the Bubble Sort algorithm to sort an array of integers in ascending order.
Description
Bubble Sort is a simple sorting algorithm that repeatedly steps through the list, compares adjacent
elements, and swaps them if they are in the wrong order. The process is repeated until the array is
sorted.
Example
• Input: [64, 34, 25, 12, 22, 11, 90]
• Output: [11, 12, 22, 25, 34, 64, 90]
 Input Validation:
o It checks that the input is an array of integers. If the input is invalid, it returns an
appropriate message.
